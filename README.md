# 100 Days of Product Management – Daily Case Studies

Welcome to my **Product Management** journey! This repository is where I’ll be documenting **one short case study per day**, focusing on different aspects of product management—from user discovery and market sizing, to strategy, roadmaps, and beyond.

## What This Repo Contains

1. **Daily Case Studies**  
   Each day gets its own Markdown file (e.g., `Day1.md`, `Day2.md`, etc.). Inside, I’ll use a consistent template to structure my thinking:
   - **Problem Statement**  
   - **Proposed Approach / Hypothesis**  
   - **Key Metrics & Success Criteria**  
   - **Challenges & Trade-Offs**  
   - **Conclusions & Reflection**  

2. **Template**  
   I’m using a generic [case study template]([templates/DailyCaseStudyTemplate.md](https://github.com/harshitha-manjunatha/Product-Management/blob/main/template.md)) so every post has a similar flow.

## Day-by-Day Progress

- **[Day 1]()** – *[Brief description of the topic]*  
- **Day 2** – *(To be added soon!)*
- **Day 3** – *(To be added soon!)*
- …  
- **Day 100** – *Final summary & wrap-up*

*(I will update this section with links as new days go live.)*

## How to Follow Along

- **LinkedIn**: I’ll share daily highlights of each case study on [my LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/harshitha-manjunath). Feel free to connect and leave feedback!
- **GitHub**: This repo will contain the *full* write-up for each day.

## Why 100 Days?

This format ensures consistency and continuous learning. By doing small, focused case studies each day, I’ll cover a broad set of PM fundamentals—everything from user research and MVP definition to go-to-market and growth strategies.
